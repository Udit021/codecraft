# Pattern Printer and Code Converter

This is a terminal-based Python project that combines two creative functionalities:

- **Pattern Printer**: Allows the user to print various ASCII patterns.
- **Code Converter**: Converts text to and from **Morse Code** and **NATO Phonetic Alphabet**.

It uses simple control structures, loops, string formatting, and colorized terminal outputs to create an interactive experience.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- ANSI Escape Codes (for colored terminal text)
- Core Python Concepts:
  - Strings and string formatting (`str.format()`, `f-strings`)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Save the project code in a file, e.g., `pattern_code_converter.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the file using:

```bash
python pattern_code_converter.py
```

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through building this project, I practiced:
- Working with loops to design creative pattern shapes.
- Using dictionaries for text-to-code mappings.
- Handling user input and terminal interaction with color styling.
- Modular design with conditional logic.
- Combining pattern logic with real-world text encoding.
